Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Saarland University fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Markus Bl&auml;ser](https://cc.cs.uni-saarland.de/). My research interests lie in exploring computational aspects in algebra. I am also interested in working towards social impact and am always looking for opportunities where I could use my skills to make a contribution.

Previously I completed my M.Sc. in computer science at CMI, where I worked with [Prof. Nitin Saxena](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/). Long before that, I obtained a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Delhi, where I was a part of [Axlr8r Formula Racing](https://automobileclub.iitd.ac.in/). 

Outside work, I spend a lot of time either watching or playing football, and I am a massive Liverpool FC fan. I also follow the Indian Cricket Team closely, and often go running. I also like to read from time to time.
